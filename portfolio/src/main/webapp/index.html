		<p>I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science at Cornell University. My interests are 
            in User Experience/User Design, Programming, and Web Design. Oh yeah, 
            I'm also a big fan of horticulture! This is one of my many plants, Eric:

		<h1>Hobbies</h1>
		<p>Recently, I've become more involved in an organization called Prisoner Express. 
            The aim of this organization is to help prisoners by providing resources such as books,
            newsletters, lesson plans, and general mailings. It's an organization that I've found
		    myself enjoying being a part of and one where I definitely plan on sticking through to 
            the end. 
        </p>

		<p>I also have some plans in the works to teach/co-teach a class at the local middle school
            in Ithaca. It will either be on scratch based programming or something related 
            to Anthropology.

	    <h1>Project Highlight: TCAT Alexa Skill</h1>
		<p>This simple alexa skill gives you information about the next bus heading to your 
            destination without having to unlock your phone and launch an app. Simply ask 
            alexa when the next bus to {destination} is from {origin} and alexa will tell you if
            theres anything available. If there is, alexa notifies you that the next bus departs
            in X minutes from {bus_stop_location}. Inspiration for this app came from the fact 
            that there have been many days I've been too lazy to check for the next bus on my iPhone. 
            Instead, I created a script that would automate this task. Currently, I don't have any 
            plans on continuing development of this project.
