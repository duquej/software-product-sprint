			<h1>Jonathan Duque's Portfolio</h1>
			<p>I'm a sophomore studying Computer and Information Science at Cornell University.
			My interests are in UX/UD, Programming, and Web Design. This semester I'm participating in Google's Software Product Sprint.
			Oh yeah, I also love horticulture!
			This is my plant Eric:

			<h1>TCAT Alexa Skill</h1>
			<p>This simple alexa skill tells you the information about the next bus heading to your destination without having
			to unlock your phone and launch an app. Simply ask alexa when the next bus to {destination} is from {origin} and Alexa
			will tell you if theres anything available. If there is, Alexa will tell you that it departs in X minutes from {bus_stop_location}.
			Inspiration for this app came from the fact that there have been many days I've been too lazy to check for the next bus on my iPhone.
			Instead, I automated this task as much as I could. Currently, I don't have any plans on continuing development of this project. You can
			learn about this on my github page.</p>
